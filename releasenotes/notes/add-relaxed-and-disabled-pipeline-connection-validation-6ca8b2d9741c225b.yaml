    We've introduced a new type_validation parameter to control type compatibility checks in pipeline connections. You can now choose between:
    - "strict": Enforces exact type matches or subtypes. (default behavior)
    - "relaxed": Allows bidirectional compatibility, supporting subclasses and partial Union/Literal matches.
    - "disabled": Skips type validation entirely.
